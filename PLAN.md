# Plan

Hello claude, here is a description of what we have here and what i want to do.

## The project

Currently, we have a React / Zustrand (with persist) / tailwind project that is a wordle clone, ready to be deployed on vercel.

## The Plan

I want to adapt this into a new game idea "flagdle" where you are guessing a country flag based on the most common colors in them

e.g. main: red secondary: white shape: triangle

i could do with some help tightening actual mechanism of guessing to make it fun but this is the basic idea.

## Core Challenges

- Generating the reference data, analysing all the flags of the world and categorising them as both images and json that can be used by the game to process guess data etc.
- displaying the guess mechanism in a fun but clear way
- displaying the win condition nicely
